hi this is snapp code challenge

1. first of all check confs folder for configs
2. then if you re working with linux use makefile if you re not run that commands manually
3. open http://localhost:1234/swagger/index.html for swagger 
4. Run !

just 1 service has test because the project is small and there is no unit to work with.
maybe some part of layers are same. this is all beacause of size of project
but I seperate them to differentiate. whenever it grows layers will show them selves :)
